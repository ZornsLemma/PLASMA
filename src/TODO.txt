space (and/or allow the free space to be used for code/data, if running from
sideways RAM)

Tube version

Ability to build standalone executable which runs from main RAM or sideways
ROM, so a PLASMA-implemented program can be used by a user without them knowing
or caring it's running on the PLASMA VM
