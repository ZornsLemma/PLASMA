Sandbox

Put the VM in a sideways ROM, perhaps with some library code using the free
space (and/or allow the free space to be used for code/data, if running from
sideways RAM)
- note that there's already support for modules to remain resident after
  loading by returning modkeep or modinitkeep (incidentally, these seem
  different between Apple I and Apple II for no real reason, we should probably
  follow Apple II) and a variant on this could probably allow some libraries to
  be pre-resident inside the sideways ROM area.

Add * command support to PLASMA executable

Add ability to dump memory free to PLASMA executable by issuing a command? (to
allow seeing how resident modules take up space)

I started from the Apple I version; maybe port over features from the Apple II VM
and/or "redo" the port using the Apple II version to start with

BAS128-style version; the support for the Apple /// 'aux' storage may be relevant

Tube version

Ability to build standalone executable which runs from main RAM or sideways
ROM, so a PLASMA-implemented program can be used by a user without them knowing
or caring it's running on the PLASMA VM - though possibly the auto-start
facility is sufficient for main RAM use (this doesn't address the ROM case)
