Timings are "best of several runs" using BeebEm and b-em. For some reason my numbers for BBC BASIC are significantly slower than those reported by PCW themselves, even though I've been fairly generous in my coding of the benchmarks (using resident integer variables in particular). I did the Master BASIC 4+shadow run (i.e. *SHADOW before running the benchmark) in order to have a fairer comparison with BAS128 (which uses shadow mode).
